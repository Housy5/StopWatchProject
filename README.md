# StopWatchProject
A stop watch made with java :) 

Frame is made with the Swing library.
The Receiver and Transmitter interface are there to enable communication between two classes.
  (Basically like a modified Observer Pattern): https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/observer_pattern.htm
The EventListener is made to work depending on what text is on the button. That way it's easy to change what action it should preform.
